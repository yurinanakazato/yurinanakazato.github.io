## High-redshift Galaxies (z > 6)  
The observations of the most distant galaxies have been one of the most cutting-edge research topics in astrophysics. 
In particular, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have unveiled 
high-redshift galaxies existing just 0.5 billion years after the BigBang, evidenced by the detection of oxygen emission lines.   
Nakazato et al. (2023) use the outputs of zoom-in cosmological simulations FirstLight and model emission lines from HII regions 
and investigate the ionizing states and chemical evolution  of high-redshift galaxies at z = 6-9. 
Additionally, we propose line diagnostics by using [OIII] 88um, 52um, and 5007 Ã… for future synergy of JWST and ALMA.

Recent JWST has high spatial resolution observations and reveals that high-redshift galaxies have clumpy structures of the early Universe.   
Nakazato et al. (2023) develop an algorithm to identify giant young clumps detectable by JWST. 
We show that early galaxies merge and surrounding gas is tidally compressed, forming clumpy structures.
